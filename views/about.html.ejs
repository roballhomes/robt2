    <div class="grid-cell grid7 offset3 index__title">

      <p>With a background in graphic design and animation, I decided several years ago that I wanted not just to communicate beautifully, but have the skills to create things that were functional and useful. I am now <em>a designer who can code</em>, and I love it.</p>
    <p>I am a deeply empathetic person, and passionate about designing delightful tech that can make a real difference to peopleâ€™s lives.</p>
    <p>These days I use a Lean UX process to work with agile development teams, creating websites and web applications.</p>
    <p>I help my teams to define the problems their users are facing, then visualise and prototype application solutions.</p>
    <p>I can also deliver production-ready code, using my expertise in responsive design, HTML and CSS, and even a little JS.</p>
